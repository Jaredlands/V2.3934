# V2.3934
Mod and config for Voron 2.4

## Klipper config ##

Entire configuration folder of My Voron 2.4 printer
This was inspired by the great Voron User Community

Many scripts are unmodified from shared configuration on github, See list of authors below 
[Frix_x/Klipper-voron-V2](https://github.com/Frix-x/klipper-voron-V2),
[MapleLeafMakers/Klippermacros](https://github.com/MapleLeafMakers/KlipperMacros),
[jlas1/Klicky-Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe).

Some are inspired by : Falcon14141, elpopo_eng, jschuh, Ette

Comments on printer.cfg link the authors or source of inspiration.  

Only one script is an original idea (no the best) :
- material.cfg  (material management, store parameters et apply it: _eg. pressure_advance, extrude_factor..._ )
These parameters are called from print_start, calibration macros, ...  

Many thanks to the voron french community #honhonbaguette.
