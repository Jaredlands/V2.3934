## Printed parts

All parts are designed to be printed with ABS, taking in account shrinkage. I you use  other materials (ABS+, ASA, ..) you will need to adjust your tolerances

> [!TIP] 
> The filenames prefixed ``\[fc\]`` for _filament change_. Print the 4 first layers with accent color then change to main color.   

For ABS turn off Hole and shrinkage compensation in your slicer.

The print settings are the same as Voron parts.

Most assemblies are done by screw-in-plastic. Your printed parts need to be accurate. First, print  _guide\_L.stl_ and _bracket\_L.stl_ to adjust your tolerance. Parts should slide smoothly, with not much play.

> [!WARNING]
> Check your parts before assembly, even slight warping is not acceptable.

## Assembly
### Frame assembly
- **STLs :** _\[frame_main, frame_spacer_x2, guide_L, guide_R\]_
- **Hardware :**  4 M3x10 SHCS

Mount guide on the frame, M3x10 are screwed in ABS, DO NOT OVERTIGTHEN, otherwise you will need to reprint. 

![frame assy](./images/frame1.png)

- **STLs :** _\[locker\]_
- **Hardware :** 4 M3x8, 2 M3x12 
  
Fix locker with 2 M3x8 and 2 M3x12
Insert 2 M3x8 in the frame, let about 2.5mm unscrewed, it will be used to fix the flat cable

![attach locker](./images/frame2.png)

- **Hardware :** Microswitch D2F-5L, M2x10 selftapping screws

See [backlight controller](./scripts/README.md) for wiring.

![fic microswitch](./images/frame3.png)

- **Hardware :** 2 M3x20, 2 M3 T-nuts

Fix the frame assembly to the printer frame

![attach to printer](./images/frame4.png)

### Tray assembly
- **STLs :** _\[bezel_back, bezel_front\]_
- **Hardware :** Waveshare 4.3" QLED DSI, DSI flat cable, 4 M2.5x5 screws, 4 M3x8 

Prepare the flat cable, you need to fold it twice.

![flat_cable](./images/flatecable.png)

Insert the cable into the slot, route the flat cable into the _bezel_back_ screws it to the display, 

![step1](./images/tray0.png)

mount _bezel_front_ with M3x8

![step2](./images/tray1.png)

- **STLs :** _\[bracket_L, bracket_C, bracket_R, arm\]_
- **Hardware :** 2 N52 magnets, 2 M3x8, 2 M3x12, M3 Square nuts 

![bracket assy top](./images/bracket1.png)
![bracket assy bottom](./images/bracket2.png)

- **Hardware :** 2 M3x10

![tray assy](./images/tray_assy1.png)

- **STLs :** _\[central_skirt\]_
- **Hardware :** 2 N52 magnets, 2 M3 heat inserts, 1 M3x10, 1 M3x8, 1 extension spring

![central skirt](./images/skirt.png)
![attach spring](./images/tray_assy2.png)

- **STLs :** _\[flat_cable\]_
- **Hardware :** 2 M3x16

> [!TIP]
> You have to adjust the position of the flat_cable holder while tray is closed 

![insert flat cable holder](./images/flatcable_holder.png)

Put tray into frame assembly

![final assy](./images/assy_1.png)

Time to adjust flatcable position

![secure flat cable](./images/assy2.png)

Close the tray and screw a M3x10, this one is to adjust to trigger the microswitch when the tray is open

## Lubrication

Add a little bit of lubricant in guides and locker to ensure that parts slide smoothly 

## Configuration of backlight Controller
 In order to turn on and off backlight, you need to install a service. See related [Readme.md](./scripts/)
