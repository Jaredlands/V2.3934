## Printed parts

This mod was designed to be printed with ABS, taking in account shrinkage. I you use  other materials (ABS+, ASA, ..) you will need to adjust tolerances

For ABS turn off Hole and shrinkage compensation in your slicer.
Print settings same as Voron parts.

Most assembly is done by screw in plastic. Your printed parts need to be accurate. First print  _guide\_L.stl_ and _bracket\_L.stl_ to adjust your tolerance. Parts should slide smoothly, with not much play.

> [!WARNING]
> Check your parts before assembly, even slight warping is not acceptable.

## Assembly
